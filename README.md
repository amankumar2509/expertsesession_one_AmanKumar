# Problem Statement :-
- You have to write an example code to demonstrate the same concept of data preparation and searching. It could be any dataset, any scenario, any use-case, as per your imagination.
It covers the following points:
- Merging data from multiple data sources.
- Performing memory efficient searching with Global Secondary Index.
- Re Structioring of data.

# To run the code:

1.Clone the github repository in your computer. git clone //https://github.com/amankumar2509/expertsesession_one_AmanKumar.git
2.Run DataPreparation.ipynb file which will create two json files in datastore folder.
3.Run DatabaseSearch.ipynb file to search for car names across the newly created data store.
That's it.
